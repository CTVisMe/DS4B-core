This repo contains files that I have used to teach the class "Data Science for Business" at NYU Stern Business School - starting in 2023. 

There is a syllabus file that lays out how the course is taught - it is a one-semester course consisting of 12 3-hour weekly sessions. 

The class is intended to teach data science basics, but from a business perspective that is appropriate for students who want to learn the process of data science and how it pertains to real-world problems

Components of the Repo
- **Slides** Powerpoint decks that cover weekly lectures
- **PythonModules** Python notebooks that give specific examples for covered topics, and applying the lessons to real-world data sets.
- **DataSets** Data Sets analyzed as part of the PythonModules
- **Articles** Articles for Class Discussion.  Either technical or popular news articles regarding data science topics good for discussion of real-world application of data science themes.  You can augment this with slides that cover thought questions, in **Slides/Discussions**
- **Homeworks** Three HW assignments plus a "pre-work" assignment that I provide to the class one week before the term start.

Any comments or questions, please reach out to me at CTVisMe@gmail.com
