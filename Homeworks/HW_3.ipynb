Moreover, the marketing department has come up with an amazing retention offer: the offer is guaranteed to convince customers to extend their contract for an extra year after receiving it. Unfortunately, the offer is quite expensive; it costs $200. __You have enough budget to give the retention offer to up to 25% of the customers whose contracts are expiring.__\n","\n","It is your job to use data from previous contract expirations to build a churn predictive model and make a recommendation of whom to target with the offers.
