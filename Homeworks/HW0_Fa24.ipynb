For those not familiar with Colab, it is a cloud-based IDE that makes it easy to share notebooks and data and work jointly with others.  Some of you may use other IDEs (Jupyter, VSCode,  Anaconda Spyder, or other) – that is fine – these are similar notebook-based environments that run locally on your machine instead of on the cloud.    However, all of the examples in class and homeworks will be done using Colab, so it will be good to be familiar with it.  \n","\n","**This assigment will be graded by completion only.**\n","\n","To get a refresher on Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, and Python basics, walk through the following notebooks and the links therein.
