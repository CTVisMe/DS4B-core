Try and do it yourself first, and then reach out for other resources.  Google your problem and it will likely take you to posts at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), a popular programming question and answer site, with an extremely rich repository of solutions to problems that people have encountered.  It is likely that someone has asked the question you need answering and has posted a solution.\n","\n","It is also easy to ask a question of GenAI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini (which is built right into Colab).  These will often get you the correct answer, but I caution against simple cut-and-paste of the solution.  Try and work your way through the code and understand the answer, and even ask ChatGPT questions like \"why is that line in the code?\".  Typing the code in instead of cut/paste can help you with the learning process.\n","\n","Programming can be frustrating. It's natural to get stuck or frustrated from time to time, even with the incredible resources that are now available. Take breaks, ask others for help, and be kind to yourself :)\n","\n","---\n","\n","For refreshers, here are some resources:\n","\n","- Courses at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)\n","- Online courses at [datacamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/)\n","- [Codecademy's Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). Working though this class will give you a _great_ foundation for Python.\n","- [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython-ebook/dp/B009NLMB8Q/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=) was the book that Prof. Foster suggested to prior iterations of this course. You can take a look at the chapters: Preliminaries, Introductory Examples (e.g. \"Counting Time Zones with pandas”), IPython (page 46 to 62) and specially, Pandas--one of the main Python packages for data analysis.  We will work with Pandas in class.\n","- [Pandas Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Pandas-Cookbook-Scientific-Computing-Visualization/dp/1784393878) is another great resource to learn Pandas. It has lots of practice problems with detailed solutions in IPython notebooks.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1bS71eadLWQIK8jYJtmHMSvXdiXuSgWRe","timestamp":1721933580630},{"file_id":"1jTZkOLmkE_911vNwIGqh_KHhtRWtIcAa","timestamp":1721933372547}],"toc_visible":true}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
